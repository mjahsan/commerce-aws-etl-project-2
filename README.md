🚀 EVENT-DRIVEN AWS DATA PIPELINE (S3 → LAMBDA → GLUE → S3)


📌 OVERVIEW
This project implements an event-driven data pipeline on AWS that ingests raw JSON data, validates files, performs transformations using Spark SQL, and produces analytics-ready Parquet output using a Bronze–Silver–Gold lakehouse pattern.
The pipeline simulates a real-world commerce data processing workflow using fully managed AWS services and production-oriented design practices.


🏗️ ARCHITECTURE:

🔄 Flow:
📥 Raw JSON files are uploaded to the Bronze layer in Amazon S3
⚡ An S3 event triggers an AWS Lambda function
🧪 Lambda performs file-level validation (format & naming)
📤 Valid files are promoted to the Silver layer
🚦 Once all required datasets are present, Lambda triggers an AWS Glue Spark job
🔥 Glue performs transformations using Spark SQL
📊 Final aggregated output is written to the Gold layer in Parquet format
🖼️ Refer to: architecture/pipeline_architecture.png


🗂️ DATA MODELS:

📁 Input Datasets:
-> users.json
-> events.json
-> orders.json
Each dataset contains ~1 million records, generated using Python to test scalability and performance.


🔧 TRANSFORMATIONS:

The AWS Glue job:
✅ Handles null values
🔗 Joins users, events, and orders datasets
📈 Aggregates user-level activity metrics
🧾 Produces a single user_activity dataset
💾 Writes output as Parquet to the Gold layer
All transformations are implemented using Spark SQL for clarity, performance, and maintainability.

🔐 SECURITY:

🔑 IAM execution roles created for Lambda and Glue
📜 Least-privilege policies defined in iam/
🔒 S3 data encrypted using AWS KMS
🛡️ KMS key policies included for reference
❌ No credentials stored in the repository
This project follows security best practices aligned with production-grade AWS pipelines.


▶️ HOW TO RUN (HIGH LEVEL):

🧱 Deploy IAM roles and policies
🪣 Create an S3 bucket with Bronze / Silver / Gold structure
⚡ Create a Lambda function for Bronze → Silver validation with an S3 upload trigger
📥 Upload sample data to the Bronze layer
🔁 Lambda automatically validates and promotes data
🔥 Glue job is triggered automatically
📊 Final Parquet output is available in the Gold layer
